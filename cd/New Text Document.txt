1.A company wants to track the usage of its mobile app by recording users' login times and dates. The company stores the login information in a 2D array of strings, logs, which contains data in the format ["username<user_id>","login_time", "login_date"].

They need a function to process the logs and output a 2D array of strings, sorted lexicographically, that displays the number of times each user logs in per day in the format ["username<user_id>","login_date", "login_count"]. It must filter invalid data in the input array rather than write it to the output array.

Users should be sorted in lexicographic order based on their user id. Each user's information should be sorted by the login date in ascending order. The date and time are provided in YYYY-MM- DD and HH:MM:SS format, and the username has the format "userX" where X is an integer.

Example

As an example, logs = [["user1","09:00:00","2021- 01-01" ], 
["user1","13:00:00","2021-01-01" ],
["user2","14:00:00","2021-01-01" ], 
[ "user1"," "20:00:00","2021-01-02" ],
["user2","21:00:00","2021-01-01" ]].

In that case, the function should output the login counts for each user per day, sorted lexicographically, resulting in a 2-d array of strings in the format 
[["user1","2021-01-01","2"], [ "user1","2021-01-02","1"], ["user2","2021-01- 01","2" ]].

Function Description:

Complete the function countUserLogins in the editor below.

countUserLogins has the following parameter(s): string logs[n][3]: login users, dates, and times

the program must be within a function vector<vector<string>> countUserlogins(vector<vector<string>> logs)


2.Consider a string, 5, that is a series of characters,each followed by its frequency as an integer. Thestring is not compressed correctly, so there may bemultiple occurrences of the same character. Aproperly compressed string will consist of oneinstance of each character in alphabetical orderfollowed by the total count of that character withinthe string.

Example

The string 'a3c9b2c1' has two instances where 'c isfollowed by a count: once with 9 occurrences, andagain with 1. It should be compressed to ^ prime a * 3b * 2c * 10'

Function Description

Complete the function betterCompression in theeditor below.

betterCompression has the following parameter:sta compressed string

Returns:

string: the properly compressed string

Constraints

1 \le size of S <= 100000

a' \le characters in S <=^ prime z

1 \le frequency of each character in S <= 1000

Consider a string, 5, that is a series of characters, each followed by its frequency as an integer. The string is not compressed correctly, so there may be multiple occurrences of the same character. A properly compressed string will consist of one instance of each character in alphabetical order followed by the total count of that character within the string.

Example

The string 'a3c9b2c1' has two instances where 'c is followed by a count: once with 9 occurrences, and again with 1. It should be compressed to 'a3b2c10'

Function Description

Complete the function betterCompression in the editor below.

betterCompression has the following parameter: 
S:a compressed string

Returns:

string: the properly compressed string

Constraints

1 <= size of S <= 100000

a<= characters in S <= 'z'

1 <= frequency of each character in S <= 1000 

the program must be within a function  string betterCompression(string s)
also the function is expected to return a STRING and accepts STRING s as a parameter.




2.

Given a string that consists of lowercase English letters and the characters '#'(ASCII value 35) and '!' (ASCII value 33), determine the number of times a character will be escaped. A character will be escaped if:

It is a lowercase English letter, and

There is a '!' character immediately before it, and 

Both the lowercase English letter and the '!' character are between a starting and an ending '#' character

Example

expression = '#ab!c#de!f'

The string is escaped once at '!c'. The substring '!f'is not between '#'characters so it is not escaped. Return 1.

Function Description

Complete the numberOfCharactersEscaped function in the editor below.

numberOfCharactersEscaped has the following parameter(s):

expression: a string to evaluate

Returns

int: the number of characters that are escaped

Constraints

1 <= length of expression < 10^5

The # characters will not be nested

Every opening # character will have a closing # character

complete the 'numberOfCharcterEscaped' function like given below.

the function is expected to return an INTGER.
the fuction accepts STRING expression as parameter

the program must be within a function-  int numberOfCharactersEscaped(string expression)
